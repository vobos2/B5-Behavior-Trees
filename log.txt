fa3451f was Alexsandr Vobornov, 2 days ago, message: Added phone (as loot obj from boss) and the affordance to pick it up and talk. Pressing the second button in part 1 now kills all characters with a cool animation. Need to script boss fights now and add dialogue
18dc202 was Alexsandr Vobornov, 3 days ago, message: Can now send n agents to a destination. Got door triggers to work. Part 1 (of 3) is working, agent now presses button to make bridge appear with left hand, need to add behavior for right hand. Agents can also navigate to every meeting point in the behavior tree. Need to code the 'bad guy' fight and boss fight. And add loot pickup. Also need to figure out how to stop the game from crashing at the end of the sequence
c49ae93 was Alexsandr Vobornov, 4 days ago, message: Created a 3 part level that will be used as the story. n Players enter -> user must choose button -> different outcome to get to part 2 -> players fight n guards -> players get to boss round -> random player walks up to get loot after defeating boss (mechanics not yet thought out)
aafe74a was Alexsandr Vobornov, 4 days ago, message: Added behavior tree that will allow a character to kick another character. Spin death animation plays after. Non IK
e55da08 was Alexsandr Vobornov, 5 days ago, message: Added button press affordance where door goes open. Pressing it again causes door to shut. As of this implement the agent will keep pressing the button triggering the door
3c8f169 was Alexsandr Vobornov, 6 days ago, message: Added IK demo. Dissected it, trying to implement throwing between two agents. Afterwards should be easy to scale. Goal is to make ball fly and then agent2 to walk to it, pick it up, throw it back.
db11456 was Alexsandr Vobornov, 7 days ago, message: Added camera controller. Added test affordances where two agents go to a meeting point and converse. Added code to support multiple agents (but not yet implemented). Next step is to author a story so I can add more affordances with objects involved and add assertions/user input
